				<p><b>Completed:</b></p>
				<p>Efforts so far have focused on the installation and setting up of the MediaWiki software, getting a logical system set up to contain the
				nation articles, region articles, and articles related to other subjects of interest. Afforess has been hard at work writing a bot which takes
				data from the daily NS dumps, as well as shards, crunches the numbers and then writes the articles to NSWiki.<p>
				As you will be aware, a first sweep of the regions has already been completed, and we have a number of ideas for further information we can add
				particularly around embassies, comments on trends within the region (for example comparing the number of nations in the region before and after
				updates to comment on the regional population growth (or shrinkage) and other such useful information.
				
				<p><center><img src="http://nswiki.org/logos/nswikilogo.png" style="width: 40%; max-width: 200px;"></center></p>
				
				<p><b>Next steps:</b></p>
				
				The next priority however is to work on nation pages, which will be more complicated but work under a broadly similar system as the region pages
				. Clearly there is more to be said on the subject of nations than of regions, and it is important that given the massive number of nations that
				there is enough variety in the articles to keep NSWiki interesting.<p>
				
				We are also looking into a new theme for NSWiki, as opposed to the current basic MediaWiki theme. Using a Bootstrap 3-compatible theme means
				we can use nicer formatting on our pages that will work for any sized-browser, and also bring it into line with the theme used on NSWiki.<p>
				Also, a priority of mine is to start writing the help pages that will ensure we have a constant style across NSWiki, and the inclusion of
				<a href="http://nswiki.org/index.php?title=NSWiki:Linking">pages on linking between nation, region and article pages</a> will hopefully ensure
				contributors are linking in an efficient and visually-pleasing way.<p>
			
				We are also setting up a features suggestion system, located on our: <a href="https://nswiki.uservoice.com/forums/239544-general">UserVoice page</a>.<p>

				<p><b>What Happened:</b></p>
				<p>Earlier today we were graced with <span style="color: #663399;">[violet]</span>'s recent new addition to NationStates, Dispatches!
				As part of the usual round of bug fixing process I was poking around how exactly dispatches work. I was testing some changes to 
				the code that involves how dispatches are upvoted and downvoted. When you upvote or downvote a particular dispatch, your browser is
				making a request to a url that may look like this: </p><pre>http://www.nationstates.net/page=ajax2/a=setendo/id=210646/v=-1/localid=i3cf8XpWmiWEB</pre>
				I was writing some javascript to add upvote / downvote arrows on page's national happenings, where it shows a dispatch is published. In the process
				some test code that I had written for a dispatch was accidentally released and downloaded by about 30 players before it was reverted. As a result,
				each of these players that downloaded this code, all upvoted the dispatch I had written for testing. <p></p>
				<p>After this incident occurred, I stopped what I was working on to ensure that the released patch was taken down and not downloaded by additional users.
					The code was only available for a fewer than 10 seconds. </p>
					
				<p><b>Why This Happened:</b></p>
				<p>Normally new development for NationStates++ updates occurs in a separate location than where the live, production codebase lives. Due to the rushed nature of the 2.2x series
				of releases (as a result of changes to the NationStates site), I never set up a new development environment for 2.3.x releases.</p>
				
				<p><b>What Will Be Changed:</b></p>
				<p>I will be taking steps to ensure that future NationStates++ development does not interfere with the live codebase. If I had followed my normal prodecures, this incident would not
				have been possible. I am making the setup of development environments, isolated from the main codebase a priority.
